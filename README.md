# SQLAlchemy Challenge: Climate Analysis and API

This repository contains a climate analysis project focused on Hawaii weather data, built using SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Flask. The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Data Exploration in Jupyter Notebook:**  
  Uses SQLAlchemy ORM, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize precipitation and temperature data from Hawaii.

- **Flask API:**  
  Provides several endpoints that serve JSON responses based on the climate database. These endpoints include precipitation data, station information, temperature observations, and dynamic date-based queries.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


- **`SQLAlchemy-Challenge/`**  
  Contains the main challenge files:
  - **`climate_starter.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that performs data analysis including database connection, precipitation analysis, station analysis, and plotting.
  - **`app.py`**: A Flask application that sets up API endpoints to serve climate data.
  
- **`SQLAlchemy-Challenge/Resources/`**  
  Contains the data files:
  - **`hawaii.sqlite`**: A SQLite database containing Hawaii climate data.
  - **`hawaii_stations.csv`** and **`hawaii_measurements.csv`**: CSV files used to understand the database structure.
